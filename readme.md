WHAT WAS MY MOTIVATION?-
i built this project to make sure the website was accesible to people with disabilities.

 To solve this problem i added "alts" in every image so that poeple who are using screen readers get a good description of what the image is so they can paint a relative picture in their head.

WHAT DID I LEARN?-
I learned that there are mutiple things needed to be done to make a website accesible for poeple with disablities, ive also learned ways to neatly organize code.
